## Adding new code

1. Read the logs of run_tests / run_benchmark: the python traceback should be shown
2. If this does not help, try running pytest locally per the instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md
3. If this does not help, try running nextflow locally per the instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Adding new containers

1. Read the logs of run_tests / run_benchmark: the docker output should be shown
2. If this does not help, try building the images locally per the instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md
