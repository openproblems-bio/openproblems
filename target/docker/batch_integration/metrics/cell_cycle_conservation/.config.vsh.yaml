      description: "The cell-cycle conservation score evaluates how well the cell-cycle\
        \ effect can be\ncaptured before and after integration. We computed cell-cycle\
        \ scores using Scanpy’s\nscore_cell_cycle function with a reference gene set\
        \ from Tirosh et al for the\nrespective cell-cycle phases. We used the same\
        \ set of cell-cycle genes for mouse and\nhuman data (using capitalization\
        \ to convert between the gene symbols). We then computed\nthe variance contribution\
        \ of the resulting S and G2/M phase scores using principal\ncomponent regression\
        \ (Principal component regression), which was performed for each\nbatch separately.\
        \ The differences in variance before, Varbefore, and after, Varafter,\nintegration\
        \ were aggregated into a final score between 0 and 1, using the equation:\n\
        CCconservation=1−|Varafter−Varbefore|/Varbefore.\n\nIn this equation, values\
        \ close to 0 indicate lower conservation and 1 indicates complete\nconservation\
        \ of the variance explained by cell cycle. In other words, the variance\n\
        remains unchanged within each batch for complete conservation, while any deviation\
        \ from\nthe preintegration variance contribution reduces the score.\n"
