      description: "Principal component regression, derived from PCA, has previously\
        \ been used to quantify\nbatch removal. Briefly, the R2 was calculated from\
        \ a linear regression of the\ncovariate of interest (for example, the batch\
        \ variable B) onto each principal component.\nThe variance contribution of\
        \ the batch effect per principal component was then\ncalculated as the product\
        \ of the variance explained by the ith principal component (PC)\nand the corresponding\
        \ R2(PCi|B). The sum across all variance contributions by the batch\neffects\
        \ in all principal components gives the total variance explained by the batch\n\
        variable as follows:\nVar(\U0001d436|\U0001d435)=∑\U0001d456=1\U0001d43aVar(\U0001d436\
        |PC\U0001d456)×\U0001d4452(PC\U0001d456|\U0001d435),\n\nwhere Var(C|PCi) is\
        \ the variance of the data matrix C explained by the ith principal\ncomponent.\n"
