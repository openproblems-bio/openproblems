    description: "Naive Bayes classification leverages probabilistic models based\
      \ on Bayes' theorem\nto classify cells into different types. In the context\
      \ of single-cell datasets, this method\nutilizes the probabilities of features\
      \ to project cell type labels from a reference dataset\nto new datasets. The\
      \ algorithm assumes independence between features, making it computationally\n\
      efficient and well-suited for high-dimensional data. It is particularly useful\
      \ for annotating\ncells in atlas-scale datasets, ensuring consistency and alignment\
      \ with existing reference annotations.\n"
