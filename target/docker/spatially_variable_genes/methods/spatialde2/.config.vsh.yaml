    description: "Spatial transcriptomics is now a mature technology, allowing to\
      \ assay gene expression changes \nin the histological context of complex tissues.\
      \ A canonical analysis workflow starts with the \nidentification of tissue zones\
      \ that share similar expression profiles, followed by the detection \nof highly\
      \ variable or spatially variable genes. Rapid increases in the scale and complexity\
      \ of \nspatial transcriptomic datasets demand that these analysis steps are\
      \ conducted in a consistent \nand integrated manner, a requirement that is not\
      \ met by current methods. To address this, we \nhere present SpatialDE2, which\
      \ unifies the mapping of tissue zones and spatial variable gene \ndetection\
      \ as integrated software framework, while at the same time advancing current\
      \ algorithms \nfor both of these steps. Formulated in a Bayesian framework,\
      \ the model accounts for the Poisson \ncount noise, while simultaneously offering\
      \ superior computational speed compared to previous methods. \nWe validate SpatialDE2\
      \ using simulated data and illustrate its utility in the context of two real-world\
      \ \napplications to the spatial transcriptomics profiles of the mouse brain\
      \ and human endometrium.\n"
