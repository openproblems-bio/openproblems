    description: "Spatial transcriptomic studies are becoming increasingly common\
      \ and large, posing important \nstatistical and computational challenges for\
      \ many analytic tasks. Here, we present SPARK-X, \na non-parametric method for\
      \ rapid and effective detection of spatially expressed genes in large \nspatial\
      \ transcriptomic studies. SPARK-X not only produces effective type I error control\
      \ and \nhigh power but also brings orders of magnitude computational savings.\
      \ We apply SPARK-X to \nanalyze three large datasets, one of which is only analyzable\
      \ by SPARK-X. In these data, \nSPARK-X identifies many spatially expressed genes\
      \ including those that are spatially \nexpressed within the same cell type,\
      \ revealing new biological insights.\n"
