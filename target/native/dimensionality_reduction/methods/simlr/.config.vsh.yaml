    description: "Single-cell Interpretation via Multikernel LeaRning (SIMLR) learns\
      \ cell-to-cell similarity measures from single-cell RNA-seq data in using Gaussian\
      \ kernels with various hyperparameters in order to perform dimension reduction,\
      \ clustering and visualization. \nSIMLR assumes that if C separable populations\
      \ exist among the N cells, then the similarity matrix should have an approximate\
      \ block-diagonal structure with C blocks whereby cells have larger similarities\
      \ to other cells within the same subpopulations. Learned similarity between\
      \ two cells should be small if the Euclidean distance between them is large.\
      \ The cell-to-cell similarity is computed using an optimization framework over\
      \ an N x N similarity matrix, a low-dimensional auxilary matrix enforcing low\
      \ rank constraint on the similarity matrix, and the kernel weights. \nDimension\
      \ reduction is achieved by the stochastic neighbor embedding methodology with\
      \ the learned similarities as input. \n"
