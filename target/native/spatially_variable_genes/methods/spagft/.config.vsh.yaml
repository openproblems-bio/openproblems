    summary: "SpaGFT is a graph Fourier transform for tissue module identification\
      \ from spatially resolved transcriptomics"
    description: "The tissue module (TM) was defined as an architectural area containing\
      \ recurrent cellular \ncommunities executing specific biological functions at\
      \ different tissue sites. \nHowever, the computational identification of TMs\
      \ poses challenges owing to their various \nlength scales, convoluted biological\
      \ processes, not well-defined molecular features, and \nirregular spatial patterns.\
      \ Here, we present a hypothesis-free graph Fourier transform model, \nSpaGFT,\
      \ to characterize TMs. For the first time, SpaGFT transforms complex gene expression\
      \ \npatterns into simple, but informative signals, leading to the accurate identification\
      \ of \nspatially variable genes (SVGs) at a fast computational speed. Based\
      \ on clustering the \ntransformed signals of the SVGs, SpaGFT provides a novel\
      \ computational framework for TM \ncharacterization. Three case studies were\
      \ used to illustrate TM identities, the biological \nprocesses of convoluted\
      \ TMs in the lymph node, and conserved TMs across multiple samples constituting\
      \ \nthe complex organ. The superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability\
      \ of SpaGFT indicate \nthat it is a novel and powerful tool for the investigation\
      \ of TMs to gain new insights into a variety \nof biological questions.\n"
