    description: "Multi-Layer Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network that\n\
      consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. Each neuron computes\
      \ a\nweighted sum of all neurons in the previous layer and transforms it with\n\
      nonlinear activation function. The output layer provides the final\nprediction,\
      \ and network weights are updated by gradient descent to minimize\nthe cross\
      \ entropy loss. Here, the input data is 100-dimensional whitened PCA\ncoordinates\
      \ for each cell, and we use two hidden layers of 100 neurons each.\n"
