summary: "Predicting the profiles of one modality (e.g. protein abundance) from another (e.g. mRNA expression)."

motivation: |
  Experimental techniques to measure multiple modalities within the same single cell are increasingly becoming available. 
  The demand for these measurements is driven by the promise to provide a deeper insight into the state of a cell. 
  Yet, the modalities are also intrinsically linked. We know that DNA must be accessible (ATAC data) to produce mRNA 
  (expression data), and mRNA in turn is used as a template to produce protein (protein abundance). These processes 
  are regulated often by the same molecules that they produce: for example, a protein may bind DNA to prevent the production 
  of more mRNA. Understanding these regulatory processes would be transformative for synthetic biology and drug target discovery. 
  Any method that can predict a modality from another must have accounted for these regulatory processes, but the demand for 
  multi-modal data shows that this is not trivial.

  In this task, the goal is to take one modality and predict the other modality for all
  features in each cell. This task requires translating information between multiple layers of
  gene regulation. In some ways, this is similar to the task of machine translation. In machine translation, the same
  sentiment is expressed in multiple languages and the goal is to train a model to represent the same meaning in a different
  language. In this context, the same cellular state is measured in two different feature sets and the goal of this task
  is to translate the information about cellular state from one modality to the other.
