    Cellular function is regulated by the complex interplay of different types of biological
    molecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, etc.), which determine the state of a cell. Several
    recently described technologies allow for simultaneous measurement of different aspects
    of cellular state. For example, sci-CAR [@cao2018joint]
    jointly profiles RNA expression and chromatin accessibility on the same cell and
    CITE-seq [@stoeckius2017simultaneous] measures
    surface protein abundance and RNA expression from each cell. These technologies enable
    us to better understand cellular function, however datasets are still rare and there are
    tradeoffs that these measurements make for to profile multiple modalities.

    Joint methods can be more expensive or lower throughput or more noisy than measuring a
    single modality at a time. Therefore it is useful to develop methods that are capable
    of integrating measurements of the same biological system but obtained using different
    technologies on different cells.

  In this task, the goal is to learn a latent space where cells profiled by different
  technologies in different modalities are matched if they have the same state. We use
  jointly profiled data as ground truth so that we can evaluate when the observations
  from the same cell acquired using different modalities are similar. A perfect result
  has each of the paired observations sharing the same coordinates in the latent space.
  A method that can achieve this would be able to match datasets across modalities to
  enable multimodal cellular analysis from separately measured profiles.
