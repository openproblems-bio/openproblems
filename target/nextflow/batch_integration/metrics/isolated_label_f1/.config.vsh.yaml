      summary: "Evaluate how well isolated labels coincide with clusters"
      description: "We developed two isolated label scores to evaluate how well the\
        \ data integration methods\ndealt with cell identity labels shared by few\
        \ batches. Specifically, we identified\nisolated cell labels as the labels\
        \ present in the least number of batches in the\nintegration task.\nThe score\
        \ evaluates how well these isolated labels separate from other cell identities.\n\
        We implemented the isolated label metric in two versions:\n(1) the best clustering\
        \ of the isolated label (F1 score) and\n(2) the global ASW of the isolated\
        \ label. For the cluster-based score,\nwe first optimize the cluster assignment\
        \ of the isolated label using the F1 score˚\nacross louvain clustering resolutions\
        \ ranging from 0.1 to 2 in resolution steps of 0.1.\nThe optimal F1 score\
        \ for the isolated label is then used as the metric score.\nThe F1 score is\
        \ a weighted mean of precision and recall given by the equation:\n\U0001d439\
        1=2×(precision×recall)/(precision+recall).\n\nIt returns a value between 0\
        \ and 1,\nwhere 1 shows that all of the isolated label cells and no others\
        \ are captured in\nthe cluster. For the isolated label ASW score, we compute\
        \ the ASW of isolated\nversus nonisolated labels on the PCA embedding (ASW\
        \ metric above) and scale this\nscore to be between 0 and 1. The final score\
        \ for each metric version consists of\nthe mean isolated score of all isolated\
        \ labels.\n"
