      description: "The HVG conservation score is a proxy for the preservation of\n\

        \ data matrix, we computed the number of HVGs before\nand after correction\
        \ for each batch via Scanpy’s\nhighly_variable_genes function (using the ‘\
        cell ranger’ flavor).\nIf available, we computed 500 HVGs per batch. If fewer\
        \ than 500\ngenes were present in the integrated object for a batch,\nthe\
        \ number of HVGs was set to half the total genes in that batch.\nThe overlap\
        \ coefficient is as follows:\noverlap(\U0001d44b,\U0001d44c)=|\U0001d44b∩\U0001d44c\
        |/min(|\U0001d44b|,|\U0001d44c|),\n\nwhere X and Y denote the fraction of\
