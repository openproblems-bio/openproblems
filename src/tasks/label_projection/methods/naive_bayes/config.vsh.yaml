    summary: "Naive Bayes classification using feature probabilities to project cell type labels from a reference dataset."
    description: |
      Naive Bayes classification leverages probabilistic models based on Bayes' theorem
      to classify cells into different types. In the context of single-cell datasets, this method
      utilizes the probabilities of features to project cell type labels from a reference dataset
      to new datasets. The algorithm assumes independence between features, making it computationally
      efficient and well-suited for high-dimensional data. It is particularly useful for annotating
      cells in atlas-scale datasets, ensuring consistency and alignment with existing reference annotations.
