    summary: "Assumes cells with similar gene expression belong to the same cell type, and assigns an unlabelled cell the most common cell type among its k nearest neighbors in PCA space."
    description: |
      Using the "k-nearest neighbours" approach, which is a
      popular machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks.
      The assumption underlying KNN in this context is that cells with similar gene
      expression profiles tend to belong to the same cell type. For each unlabelled
      cell, this method computes the $k$ labelled cells (in this case, 5) with the
      smallest distance in PCA space, and assigns that cell the most common cell
      type among its $k$ nearest neighbors.
