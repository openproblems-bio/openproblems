    summary: "Non-linear method that uses a neural network to preserve pairwise distances between data points in a high-dimensional space."
    description: |
      A neural network implementation of elastic embedding. It is a
      non-linear method that preserves pairwise distances between data points.
      NeuralEE uses a neural network to optimize an objective function that
      measures the difference between pairwise distances in the original
      high-dimensional space and the two-dimensional space. It is computed on both
      the recommended input from the package authors of 500 HVGs selected from a
      logged expression matrix (without sequencing depth scaling) and the default
      logCPM matrix with 1000 HVGs.
