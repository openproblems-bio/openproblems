    summary: "A manifold learning algorithm that utilizes topological data analysis for dimension reduction."
    description: |
      Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection is an algorithm for
      dimension reduction based on manifold learning techniques and ideas from
      topological data analysis. We perform UMAP on the logCPM expression matrix
      before and after HVG selection and with and without PCA as a pre-processing
      step.
