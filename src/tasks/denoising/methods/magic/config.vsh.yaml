    summary: "MAGIC imputes and denoises scRNA-seq data that is noisy or dropout-prone."
    description: "MAGIC (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells) is a method for
        imputation and denoising of noisy or dropout-prone single cell RNA-sequencing
        data. Given a normalised scRNA-seq expression matrix, it first calculates
        Euclidean distances between each pair of cells in the dataset, which is then
        augmented using a Gaussian kernel (function) and row-normalised to give a
        normalised affinity matrix. A t-step markov process is then calculated, by
        powering this affinity matrix t times. Finally, the powered affinity matrix
        is right-multiplied by the normalised data, causing the final imputed values
        to take the value of a per-gene average weighted by the affinities of cells.
        The resultant imputed matrix is then rescaled, to more closely match the
        magnitude of measurements in the normalised (input) matrix."
