    summary: "ALRA imputes missing values in scRNA-seq data by computing rank-k approximation, thresholding by gene, and rescaling the matrix."
    description: |
      Adaptively-thresholded Low Rank Approximation (ALRA). 
      
      ALRA is a method for imputation of missing values in single cell RNA-sequencing data, 
      described in the preprint, "Zero-preserving imputation of scRNA-seq data using low-rank approximation" 
      available [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/22/397588). Given a 
      scRNA-seq expression matrix, ALRA first computes its rank-k approximation using randomized SVD. 
      Next, each row (gene) is thresholded by the magnitude of the most negative value of that gene. 
      Finally, the matrix is rescaled.
