    summary: "Correct for batch effects in single-cell expression data using the mutual nearest neighbors method."
    description: |
      We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space.
      Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches.
