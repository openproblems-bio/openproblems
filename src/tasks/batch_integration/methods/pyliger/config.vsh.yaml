    summary: Python implementation of LIGER (Linked Inference of Genomic Experimental Relationships
    description: |
      LIGER (installed as rliger) is a package for integrating and analyzing multiple 
      single-cell datasets, developed by the Macosko lab and maintained/extended by the 
      Welch lab. It relies on integrative non-negative matrix factorization to identify 
      shared and dataset-specific factors.
