        summary: Overlap of highly variable genes per batch before and after integration.
        description: |
          The HVG conservation score is a proxy for the preservation of
          the biological signal. If the data integration method returned
          a corrected data matrix, we computed the number of HVGs before
          and after correction for each batch via Scanpy’s
          highly_variable_genes function (using the ‘cell ranger’ flavor).
          If available, we computed 500 HVGs per batch. If fewer than 500
          genes were present in the integrated object for a batch,
          the number of HVGs was set to half the total genes in that batch.
          The overlap coefficient is as follows:
          overlap(𝑋,𝑌)=|𝑋∩𝑌|/min(|𝑋|,|𝑌|),

          where X and Y denote the fraction of preserved informative genes.
          The overall HVG score is the mean of the per-batch HVG overlap
          coefficients.
