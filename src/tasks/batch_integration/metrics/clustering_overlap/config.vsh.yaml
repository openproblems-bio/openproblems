        summary: Adjusted Rand Index compares clustering overlap, correcting for random labels and considering correct overlaps and disagreements.
        description: |
          The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) compares the overlap of two clusterings;
          it considers both correct clustering overlaps while also counting correct
          disagreements between two clusterings.
          We compared the cell-type labels with the NMI-optimized
          Louvain clustering computed on the integrated dataset.
          The adjustment of the Rand index corrects for randomly correct labels.
          An ARI of 0 or 1 corresponds to random labeling or a perfect match,
          respectively.

        summary: "NMI compares overlap by scaling using mean entropy terms and optimizing Louvain clustering to obtain the best match between clusters and labels."
        description: |
          Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) compares the overlap of two clusterings.
          We used NMI to compare the cell-type labels with Louvain clusters computed on
          the integrated dataset. The overlap was scaled using the mean of the entropy terms
          for cell-type and cluster labels. Thus, NMI scores of 0 or 1 correspond to uncorrelated
          clustering or a perfect match, respectively. We performed optimized Louvain clustering
          for this metric to obtain the best match between clusters and labels.
