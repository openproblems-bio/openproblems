        summary: Local inverse Simpson's Index
        description: |
          Local Inverse Simpson's Index metrics adapted from Korsunsky et al. 2019 to run on
          all full feature, embedding and kNN integration outputs via shortest path-based
          distance computation on single-cell kNN graphs. The metric assesses whether clusters
          of cells in a single-cell RNA-seq dataset are well-mixed across a categorical batch
          variable.
          
          The original LISI score ranges from 0 to the number of categories, with the latter
          indicating good cell mixing. This is rescaled to a score between 0 and 1.
