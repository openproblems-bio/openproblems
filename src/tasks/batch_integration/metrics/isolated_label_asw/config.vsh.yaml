        summary: Evaluate how well isolated labels separate by average silhouette width
        description: |
          Isolated cell labels are defined as the labels present in the least number
          of batches in the integration task. The score evaluates how well these isolated labels
          separate from other cell identities.

          The isolated label ASW score is obtained by computing the
          ASW of isolated versus non-isolated labels on the PCA embedding (ASW metric above) and
          scaling this score to be between 0 and 1. The final score for each metric version
          consists of the mean isolated score of all isolated labels.
