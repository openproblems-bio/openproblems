        summary: Connectivity of the subgraph per cell type label
        description: |
          The graph connectivity metric assesses whether the kNN graph representation,
          G, of the integrated data directly connects all cells with the same cell
          identity label. For each cell identity label c, we created the subset kNN
          graph G(Nc;Ec) to contain only cells from a given label. Using these subset
          kNN graphs, we computed the graph connectivity score using the equation:

          gc =1/|C| Σc∈C |LCC(G(Nc;Ec))|/|Nc|.

          Here, C represents the set of cell identity labels, |LCC()| is the number
          of nodes in the largest connected component of the graph, and |Nc| is the
          number of nodes with cell identity c. The resultant score has a range
          of (0;1], where 1 indicates that all cells with the same cell identity
          are connected in the integrated kNN graph, and the lowest possible score
          indicates a graph where no cell is connected. As this score is computed
          on the kNN graph, it can be used to evaluate all integration outputs.
