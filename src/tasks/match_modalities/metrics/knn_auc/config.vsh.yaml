        summary: "Compute the kNN Area Under the Curve"
        description: |
          Let $f(i) \in F$ be the scRNA-seq measurement of cell $i$, and $g(i) \in G$ be the scATAC- seq measurement of cell $i$. kNN-AUC calculates the average percentage overlap of neighborhoods of $f(i)$ in $F$ with neighborhoods of $g(i)$ in $G$. Higher is better.
