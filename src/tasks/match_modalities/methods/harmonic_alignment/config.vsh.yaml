    description: |
      Harmonic Alignment is a method for integrating multimodal single-cell data. It is based on the idea of aligning the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrices of the two modalities. The alignment is achieved by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. The method is described in the following paper: https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611976236.36
