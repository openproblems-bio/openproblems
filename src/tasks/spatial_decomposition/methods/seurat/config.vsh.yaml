    summary: "Seurat method that is based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)."
    description: |
      This method applies the 'anchor'-based integration workflow introduced in Seurat v3, that enables the probabilistic transfer of annotations from a reference to a query set. First, mutual nearest neighbors (anchors) are identified from the reference scRNA-seq and query spatial datasets. Then, annotations are transfered from the single cell reference data to the sptial data along with prediction scores for each spot.
