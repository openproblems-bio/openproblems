    summary: "Tanagram maps single-cell gene expression data onto spatial gene expression data by fitting gene expression on shared genes"
    description: |
      Tangram is a method to map gene expression signatures from scRNA-seq data to spatial data. It performs the cell type mapping by learning a similarity matrix between single-cell and spatial locations based on gene expression profiles.
