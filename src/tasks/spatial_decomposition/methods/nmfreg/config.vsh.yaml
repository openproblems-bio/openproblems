    description: |
      Non-Negative Matrix Factorization regression (NMFreg) is a decomposition method that reconstructs expression of each spatial location as a weighted combination of cell-type signatures defined by scRNA-seq. It was originally developed for Slide-seq data. This is a re-implementation from https://github.com/tudaga/NMFreg_tutorial.
