    summary: "DestVI is a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types"
    description: |
      Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI) is a spatial decomposition method that leverages a conditional generative model of spatial transcriptomics down to the sub-cell-type variation level, which is then used to decompose the cell-type proportions determining the spatial organization of a tissue.
