    description: |
      RCTD (Robust Cell Type Decomposition) is a decomposition method that uses signatures learnt from single-cell data to decompose spatial expression of tissues. It is able to use a platform effect normalization step, which normalizes the scRNA-seq cell type profiles to match the platform effects of the spatial transcriptomics dataset.
