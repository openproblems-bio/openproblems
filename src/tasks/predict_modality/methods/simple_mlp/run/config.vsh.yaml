    description: |
      This folder contains the AXX solution to the OpenProblems-NeurIPS2021 Single-Cell Multimodal Data Integration.
      Team took the 4th place of the modality prediction task in terms of overall ranking of 4 subtasks: namely GEX
      to ADT, ADT to GEX, GEX to ATAC and ATAC to GEX. Specifically, our methods ranked 3rd in GEX to ATAC and 4th
      in GEX to ADT. More details about the task can be found in the
      [competition webpage](https://openproblems.bio/events/2021-09_neurips/documentation/about_tasks/task1_modality_prediction).
