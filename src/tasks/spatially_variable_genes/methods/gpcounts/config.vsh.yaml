    summary: "GPcounts is non-parametric modelling of temporal and spatial counts data from RNA-seq experiments."
    description: |
      The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods for modelling counts data using a 
      negative binomial likelihood function. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of 
      variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in the mean of the negative binomial 
      likelihood through a logarithmic link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted by maximum 
      likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time course data, showing better performance to identify 
      changes in over-dispersed counts data than methods based on Gaussian or Poisson likelihoods.
