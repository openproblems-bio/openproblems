    summary: "SpaGFT is a graph Fourier transform for tissue module identification from spatially resolved transcriptomics"
    description: |
      The tissue module (TM) was defined as an architectural area containing recurrent cellular 
      communities executing specific biological functions at different tissue sites. 
      However, the computational identification of TMs poses challenges owing to their various 
      length scales, convoluted biological processes, not well-defined molecular features, and 
      irregular spatial patterns. Here, we present a hypothesis-free graph Fourier transform model, 
      SpaGFT, to characterize TMs. For the first time, SpaGFT transforms complex gene expression 
      patterns into simple, but informative signals, leading to the accurate identification of 
      spatially variable genes (SVGs) at a fast computational speed. Based on clustering the 
      transformed signals of the SVGs, SpaGFT provides a novel computational framework for TM 
      characterization. Three case studies were used to illustrate TM identities, the biological 
      processes of convoluted TMs in the lymph node, and conserved TMs across multiple samples constituting 
      the complex organ. The superior accuracy, scalability, and interpretability of SpaGFT indicate 
      that it is a novel and powerful tool for the investigation of TMs to gain new insights into a variety 
      of biological questions.
