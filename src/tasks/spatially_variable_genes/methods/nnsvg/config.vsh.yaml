    summary: "nnSVG is based on nearest-neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) models to estimate parameters in GPs"
    description: |
      nnSVG identifies genes that vary in expression continuously across the entire tissue or within a priori defined 
      spatial domains. It uses gene-specific estimates of length scale parameters within the Gaussian process models, 
      and scales linearly with the number of spatial locations.
