    description: |
      Spatial transcriptomic studies are becoming increasingly common and large, posing important 
      statistical and computational challenges for many analytic tasks. Here, we present SPARK-X, 
      a non-parametric method for rapid and effective detection of spatially expressed genes in large 
      spatial transcriptomic studies. SPARK-X not only produces effective type I error control and 
      high power but also brings orders of magnitude computational savings. We apply SPARK-X to 
      analyze three large datasets, one of which is only analyzable by SPARK-X. In these data, 
      SPARK-X identifies many spatially expressed genes including those that are spatially 
      expressed within the same cell type, revealing new biological insights.
