    summary: "Integrating gene expression, spatial location and histology to identify spatial 
      domains and spatially variable genes by graph convolutional network."
    description: |
      To elucidate spatial gene expression variation, we present SpaGCN, a graph convolutional 
      network approach that integrates gene expression, spatial location and histology in SRT data analysis. 
      Through graph convolution, SpaGCN aggregates gene expression of each spot from its neighboring spots, 
      which enables the identification of spatial domains with coherent expression and histology. 
      The subsequent domain guided differential expression (DE) analysis then detects genes with 
      enriched expression patterns in the identified domains. Analyzing seven SRT datasets using 
      SpaGCN, we show it can detect genes with much more enriched spatial expression patterns than competing methods. Furthermore, genes detected by SpaGCN are transferrable and can be utilized to study spatial variation of gene expression in other datasets. SpaGCN is computationally 
      fast, platform independent, making it a desirable tool for diverse SRT studies.
