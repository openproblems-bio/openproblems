    summary: "SOMDE is a scalable method for identifying spatially variable genes with self-organizing map."
    description: |
      SOMDE uses self-organizing map to cluster neighboring cells into nodes, and then uses a Gaussian process 
      to fit the node-level spatial gene expression to identify SVgenes. Experiments show that SOMDE is about 
      5 to 50 times faster than existing methods with comparable results. 
      The adjustable resolution of SOMDE makes it the only method that can give results in about 
      5 min in large datasets of more than 20 000 sequencing sites.
