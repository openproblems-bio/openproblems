    summary: "Spatial PAttern Recognition via Kernels"
    description: |
      SPARK builds upon a generalized linear spatial model (GLSM) with a variety of spatial kernels to accommodate count data.
      With a newly developed penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL) algorithm, SPARK is scalable to analyzing tens of 
      thousands of genes across tens of thousands spatial locations.
