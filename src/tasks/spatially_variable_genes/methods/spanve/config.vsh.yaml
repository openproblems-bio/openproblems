    summary: "Spanve is a non-parametric statistical approach based on modeling space dependence as a distance of two distributions for detecting SV genes."
    description: |
        The depiction of in situ gene expression through spatial transcriptomics facilitates the inference of cell 
        function mechanisms. To build spatial maps of transcriptomes, the first and crucial step is to 
        identify spatially variable (SV) genes. However, current methods fall short in dealing with 
        large-scale spatial transcriptomics data and may result in a high false positive rate due to the 
        modeling of gene expression into parametric distributions. 
        This paper introduces Spanve (https://github.com/zjupgx/Spanve), a non-parametric statistical approach 
        based on modeling space dependence as a distance of two distributions for detecting SV genes. 
        The high computing efficiency and accuracy of Spanve is demonstrated through comprehensive benchmarking. 
        Additionally, Spanve can detect clustering-friendly SV genes and spatially variable co-expression, 
        facilitating the identification of spatial tissue domains by an imputation.
