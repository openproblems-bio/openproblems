    summary: "SpatialDE2: Fast and localized variance component analysis of spatial transcriptomics"
    description: |
      Spatial transcriptomics is now a mature technology, allowing to assay gene expression changes 
      in the histological context of complex tissues. A canonical analysis workflow starts with the 
      identification of tissue zones that share similar expression profiles, followed by the detection 
      of highly variable or spatially variable genes. Rapid increases in the scale and complexity of 
      spatial transcriptomic datasets demand that these analysis steps are conducted in a consistent 
      and integrated manner, a requirement that is not met by current methods. To address this, we 
      here present SpatialDE2, which unifies the mapping of tissue zones and spatial variable gene 
      detection as integrated software framework, while at the same time advancing current algorithms 
      for both of these steps. Formulated in a Bayesian framework, the model accounts for the Poisson 
      count noise, while simultaneously offering superior computational speed compared to previous methods. 
      We validate SpatialDE2 using simulated data and illustrate its utility in the context of two real-world 
      applications to the spatial transcriptomics profiles of the mouse brain and human endometrium.
