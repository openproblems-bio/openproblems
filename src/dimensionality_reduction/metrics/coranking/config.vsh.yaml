    This is a set of metrics which all use a co-ranking matrix as the basis of the metric.

    v1_commit: 14d70b330cae09527a6d4c4e552db240601e31cf
    v1_note: |
      The original v1 implementations consisted of a lot of helper functions which were 
      derived from the pyDRMetrics package. This version uses the coRanking package
      to avoid reimplementing and potentially introducing a lot of bugs in how
      the various metrics are computed.

      In addition, the references for each of the metrics were looked up to
      properly attribute the original authors of each of the metrics.
