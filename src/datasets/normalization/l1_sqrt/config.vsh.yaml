    Scaled L1 sqrt normalization.

    This normalization method causes all cells to have the same sum of values.

    Steps:

    * Compute the square root of the counts.
    * Apply L1 normalization (rescaled such that the sum of the values of each cell sum to 1).
    * Multiply by the median UMI count per cell, causing all cells to have the sum of values.
