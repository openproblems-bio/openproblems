    summary: |
      Computes the k-nearest-neighbours for each cell.
    description: |
      The resulting AnnData will contain both the knn distances and the knn connectivities in 'obsp'.

      The neighbors data is added to `.uns[key_added]`, 
      distances are stored in `.obsp[key_added+'_distances']` and 
      connectivities in `.obsp[key_added+'_connectivities']`.
