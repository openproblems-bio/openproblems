title: Control Method
description: |
  A control method is used to test the relative performance of all other methods,
  and also as a quality control for the pipeline as a whole. A control method can
  either be a positive control or a negative control. The positive control and
  negative control methods set a maximum and minimum threshold for performance,
  so any new method should perform better than the negative control methods and
  worse than the positive control method.
