# Dimensionality reduction

The goal of dimensionality reduction is to take a high-dimensional dataset and transform the data into a low-dimensional representation while preserving salient features of the original data.


# Regulatory effect prediction

Chromatin accessibility, measured using [ATAC-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATAC-seq) gives information about what parts of DNA are available for transcription. The goal of this task is to use scATAC-seq to predict gene expression in the same cells using joint-profiling experiments like [SHARE-seq](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.09.056).
