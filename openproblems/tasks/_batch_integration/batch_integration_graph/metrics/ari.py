"""
The Rand index compares the overlap of two clusterings;
it considers both correct clustering overlaps while also counting correct
disagreements between two clusterings.
Similar to NMI, we compared the cell-type labels with the NMI-optimized
Louvain clustering computed on the integrated dataset.
The adjustment of the Rand index corrects for randomly correct labels.
An ARI of 0 or 1 corresponds to random labeling or a perfect match,
respectively.
We also used the scikit-learn (v.0.22.1) implementation of the ARI.
