"""NMI compares the overlap of two clusterings.
We used NMI to compare the cell-type labels with Louvain clusters computed on
the integrated dataset. The overlap was scaled using the mean of the entropy terms
for cell-type and cluster labels. Thus, NMI scores of 0 or 1 correspond to uncorrelated
clustering or a perfect match, respectively. We performed optimized Louvain clustering
for this metric to obtain the best match between clusters and labels.
Louvain clustering was performed at a resolution range of 0.1 to 2 in steps of 0.1,
and the clustering output with the highest NMI with the label set was used. We used
the scikit-learn27 (v.0.22.1) implementation of NMI.
