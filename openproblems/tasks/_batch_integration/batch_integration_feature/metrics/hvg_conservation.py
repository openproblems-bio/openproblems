"""
The HVG conservation score is a proxy for the preservation of
the biological signal. If the data integration method returned
a corrected data matrix, we computed the number of HVGs before
and after correction for each batch via Scanpy’s
highly_variable_genes function (using the ‘cell ranger’ flavor).
If available, we computed 500 HVGs per batch. If fewer than 500
genes were present in the integrated object for a batch,
the number of HVGs was set to half the total genes in that batch.
The overlap coefficient is as follows:
overlap(𝑋,𝑌)=|𝑋∩𝑌|/min(|𝑋|,|𝑌|),

where X and Y denote the fraction of preserved informative genes.
The overall HVG score is the mean of the per-batch HVG overlap
coefficients.
